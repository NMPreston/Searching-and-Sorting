# Searching

This project includes implementations of fundamental search algorithms in Python: linear search, smart sequential search, and binary search. The lab7.py script demonstrates how each algorithm works and provides a main function to showcase their use.

Project Structure

lab7.py: The Python script containing the implementation of:
Linear Search
Smart Sequential Search
Binary Search
A main function to run and test these algorithms with various data sets.
Features

Linear Search: A simple search that checks each element in the list one by one.
Smart Sequential Search: An optimized version of linear search that stops early when the target is found.
Binary Search: A highly efficient search method for sorted lists, dividing the list in half to find the target.
